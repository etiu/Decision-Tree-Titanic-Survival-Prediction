# Decision-Tree-Titanic-Survival-Prediction
In this notebook, I explore decision trees and how pruning can improve the decision tree accuracy scores. I also show how creating a validation set can be helpful towards building a good ML model. The decision tree ML model can predict whether or not a person will survive based on several features in the data set.

Included in this repo is the csv file for the titanic dataset.
